Date: 23 March 2021

1. Each individual has the same physical backpack, but chooses different boxes.
The fitness function could evaluate individuals based on the sum of the
importance values of the boxes. However, if then weight exceeds 250 the fitness 
could go to 0.

2. The genome could be an array from 0 to n boxes. The boxes amount of boxes
and importance of the boxes could be specified by the user in input, and
stored in a dictionary for reference when creating individuals.

3. 
Mutation: change a random index in the array from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0

Mutli-Point mutation: run mutation a random amount of times,
keeping track of indices that were used previously

One-Point Crossover: Set the values after a random index in one
individuals array to the values in another, the same for the other
individual. 

Multi-Point Crossover: Perform One-Point Crossover multiple times,
keeping track of previously used indices.
